## Project Details

**Name of Project**: Apple Foliar AI

**GitHub Repository Link**:https://github.com/smaranjitghose/AppleFoliarAI

**Project Description**:
Apple is a widely consumed fruit across the world which has over 7500 cultivars in temperate and subtropical climates. Not only do they hold paramount importance for people's dietary requirements but also drive profitable businesses in several nations. The production and distribution of apples is often hindered by foliar diseases. Currently, the workers on the orchards do scouting to manually identify these diseased leafs and segregate them. For large scale orchards, this eventually turns out to be cumbersome and resource demading. Hence there is a requirement for an automated system to assist in this problem. We propose the use of neural network based algorithms to tackle this issue of diagnosis.
