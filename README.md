# FAQ

<details open><summary><b>Is participating in HCSSoC free?</b></summary>
Absolutely! All events organized by Hack Club SRM are proudly free of cost!</details>

<details><summary><b>Will I get paid for participating?</b></summary>
No, however, we have amazing schwag kits, sticker packs and other rewards for our participants!</details>

<details><summary><b>Can I submit more than one proposal?</b></summary>
We would recommend you to submit only one proposal so it's an easier and smoother experience for you, but we allow participants to be a part of at most 2 projects.</details>

<details><summary><b>Can I participate both as a Mentor and as a Participant as well?</b></summary>
Unfortunately, the answer would be no. As a Mentor, we would want you to be readily available for queries that students might have and we doubt that it would be possible for you if you are also a student attendee.
